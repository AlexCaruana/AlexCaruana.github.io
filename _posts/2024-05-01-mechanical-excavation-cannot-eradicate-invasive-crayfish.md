In our recent [paper](https://besjournals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/2688-8319.12325) in *Ecological Solutions and Evidence* we looked at an ecological restoration project in Malta that I had been involved with in 2019-2020. Invasive American Red Swamp crayfish (*Procambarus clarkii*) had been first identified within the [Fiddien Valley System](https://chadwicklakes.mt/the-valley/) in Malta in 2016 ([Deidun et al., 2018](https://doi.org/10.1093/jcbiol/ruy076); [Vella et al., 2017](https://dergipark.org.tr/en/pub/nesciences/issue/30450/328931)) and due to very limited natural predators, their population grey rapidly, causing significant damage to the delicate freshwater ecosystem present. Funded by the [European Regional Development Fund](https://kohesio.ec.europa.eu/en/projects/Q3056263), the Maltese Government did take initiative and had attempted to eradicate the invasive crayfish from this valley system through mechanical excavation, however, this effort was unsuccessful.\
