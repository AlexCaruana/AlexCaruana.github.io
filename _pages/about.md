Welcome! I am a DPhil student at University of Oxford's [Interdisciplinary Centre for Conservation Science](https://iccs.org.uk/), supervised by Professor [Joseph Bull](https://www.biology.ox.ac.uk/people/joseph-bull) and funded through Oxford's [Clarendon Scholarship](https://www.ox.ac.uk/clarendon). Prior to joining Prof. Bull's lab,
I completed my dual master's degree in Sustainable Forest and Nature Management, specialized in Conservation Biology at the [University of Copenhagen](https://studies.ku.dk/masters/sustainable-forest-and-nature-management/) and [Bangor University](https://www.bangor.ac.uk/courses/postgraduate-taught/sustainable-forest-and-nature-management-sufonama-erasmus-mundus-course), supervised by Professor [Julia P. G. Jones](https://www.bangor.ac.uk/staff/sens/julia-patricia-gordon-jones-010356/en). I obtained my bachelor's degree in Environmental Engineering from Malta's College of Arts, Science and Technology.

My interests lie in further understanding whether conservation initiatives and policies are working around the globe. As a continuation of [Bull et al. (2021)](https://doi.org/10.1111/cobi.13570) and [Grace et al. (2021)](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.biocon.2021.109259)'s research, I will be focusing on constructing counterfactuals using species population as a basis for impact evaluation.
